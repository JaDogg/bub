Code for this is from https://nakst.gitlab.io/tutorial/clap-part-1.html and other posts from same site for clap tutorial by nakst.

I added Cmake file based on other sources in free-audio/clap so this is bundled and auto installed to ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP

.clap is needed to be a directory in mac, original tutorial did not work with --> fl studio but worked with clap-host example host, with the Cmake file it can work with fl studio
